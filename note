Hi, you may have noticed that updates on this site are decreasing. My laptop that I mainly use for coding is still broken, and I had a lot of stuff on there I was working on. I'm also dealing with other personal stuff and technical issues on other devices, so while this site will still be updated, it'll be at a slower pace until I get everything figured out. No MOTDs too. Quotes and Candid requests will still be open, so feel free to submit. I hope to get everything back up and running soon. Thanks for your continued support : )
