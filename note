As much as I love adding quotes, some of them are a little too inappropriate/make people uncomfortable.
I'm not "anti-inappropriate", It's literally one of the factors that makes Bridges so unique, but
I was approached by a faculty member (please don't try to find out who) and they asked me to remove some,
so I did.
From now on, quotes that mention a name/names must have the mentioned person(s)'s consent before requesting the
quote. I know I can't really enforce it, but please have some respect.
Same goes for candids. I know I already have this rule for them, but I'd just like to make it clear.

Just to clarify, I am not going to take down the entire website if asked by the staff. I pay $22 a year
for this, I'm not gonna waste my money.

I probably will not update this website until Monday, as I will be up in the mountains.

have a good day :)
