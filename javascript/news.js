	//`Pressure! Pushin' down on me, pressin' down on you, no man ask for. Under pressure, that brings a building down, splits a family in two, puts people on streets. That's okay. That's the terror of knowing what this world is about, watchin' some good friends screamin', "Let me out!" Pray tomorrow gets me higher, pressure on people, people on streets. Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor, these are the days it never rains but it pours. People on streets. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about, watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!" Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high! Pressure on people, people on streets. Turned away from it all like a blind man, sat on the fence but it don't work, keep comin' up with love but it's so slashed and torn, why, why, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Love, love, love, love. Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking, can't we give ourselves one more chance? Why can't we give love that one more chance? Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love? 'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word, and love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night, and love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves, this is our last dance, this is our last dance, this is ourselves. Under pressure. Under pressure. Pressure.`,
