#  About
Soo, if you don't go to or not affiliated with Bridges Academy, I'd like to kindly tell you to go away please
This site is for writing down halarious quotes from people there
It's also where I post my comedic videos, because I'm not gonna purchase another domain just for that (most are unlisted because kids act in them)
# Requests
If you want to add a quote, you can use the issues tab. I count them as issues because it's an issue if I don't have all the dumbness in my collection. heh.<br>
If you want to take down one of YOUR quotes, let me know, and I'll take it down<br>
However, if you want me to take down the entire website because you don't like how it's about the school or something, I'd like to say this in the nicest way possible, but I don't really care. It's my website and I'll do what I want with it. And I know you don't want to go through all the legal trouble.<br>
If you're wondering why I wanted to address that in the readme file, it's because it's happened before, so I just want to make sure someone doesn't come crying<br>
If you don't want your name next to the quote to prove that you said it, that's fine, I have infinite question marks to use. I can also give credit to you here (in Credits) if you suggest one yourself<br>
Wanna contact me about something else? DM me on discord - @alecdiramerian
